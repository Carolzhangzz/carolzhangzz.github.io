                <h2>Introduction: The Question Is Not Whether AI Participates</h2>
                <p>As AI systems increasingly demonstrate capabilities in reading, reasoning, and experimentation, discussions about “AI replacing researchers” have become common.</p>
                <p>I believe this framing misses the point.</p>
                <p>The real question is not <strong>whether</strong> AI should participate in research, but rather:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>How should humans participate, at what level, and with what responsibilities?</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>To think clearly about this shift, it helps to step back and examine what research fundamentally consists of.</p>

                <h2>Research as a Three-Stage Process</h2>
                <p>At its core, research can be decomposed into three stages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Literature Review</strong> — understanding and synthesizing existing knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Brainstorming</strong> — generating, reframing, and positioning new research questions</li>
                    <li><strong>Experimentation</strong> — validating hypotheses and iteratively refining ideas</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Traditionally, human researchers have been responsible for all three.</p>
                <p>Today, however, AI systems are increasingly capable of contributing meaningfully to each stage.</p>
                <p>This does not eliminate the role of human researchers—but it <strong>changes where human effort is most valuable</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Reallocating Responsibilities Between Humans and AI</h2>
                <p>Rather than asking <em>what AI can do</em>, I find it more productive to ask:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>What should humans continue to do—and what should AI take over?</strong></p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>What Humans Should Remain Responsible For</h3>
                <p>Human researchers play an irreplaceable role in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Value judgment</strong>: deciding which problems are worth studying and why</li>
                    <li><strong>Articulating research significance</strong>: connecting technical work to broader social, scientific, and ethical contexts</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk and potential assessment</strong>: identifying directions that may fail locally but succeed structurally</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These tasks depend on human experience, social understanding, and ethical reasoning. They are not simply optimization problems.</p>

                <h3>What AI Is Especially Good At</h3>
                <p>AI systems, by contrast, excel at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expanding the search space</strong> beyond what any individual researcher can explore</li>
                    <li><strong>Surfacing hidden assumptions and boundaries</strong> in existing knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Proposing non-intuitive combinations</strong> that humans may overlook</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this sense, AI functions best not as an answer generator, but as a <strong>cognitive amplifier and exploration engine</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Why I Do Not Compete With Industry on Scale</h2>
                <p>I intentionally avoid framing my research around system scale, throughput, or infrastructure complexity. Industry will always have structural advantages in these dimensions.</p>
                <p>Academic research, in my view, carries a different responsibility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying <strong>long-standing structural bottlenecks</strong> across systems</li>
                    <li>Formalizing <strong>principles of successful human–AI collaboration</strong></li>
                    <li>Producing <strong>conceptual frameworks</strong> that generalize across platforms and models</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For this reason, I prioritize <strong>interpretability, generalizability, and explanatory depth</strong> over short-term performance gains.</p>

                <h2>What I Consider Valuable Research Goals</h2>
                <p>To me, meaningful research aims to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clarify what truly generalizes over time</strong>, rather than what merely performs well on a benchmark</li>
                    <li><strong>Treat human participation as a first-class system component</strong>, not an external afterthought</li>
                    <li><strong>Democratize discovery</strong>, reducing reliance on massive infrastructure or privileged access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Systems and experiments matter—but they should serve understanding, not replace it.</p>

                <h2>The Future Researcher: From Executor to Supervisor</h2>
                <p>Under this perspective, the role of the researcher shifts.</p>
                <p>Away from:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>manually reading every paper, implementing every baseline, and running every experiment by hand,</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>and toward:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>supervising exploration, shaping direction, and making high-level judgments.</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>AI agents can handle large portions of exploration and validation. Humans focus on <strong>framing, interpretation, and cross-disciplinary transfer</strong>.</p>

                <h2>A Final Question</h2>
                <p>The question I care about is not:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Can AI replace researchers?</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>but instead:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>How can AI maximally serve human researchers—amplifying judgment, creativity, and long-term insight?</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If AI can free researchers from excessive low-level detail, research may once again become what it should be:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>a deeply intellectual, creative, and meaningful pursuit.</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
